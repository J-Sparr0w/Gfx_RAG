# GFX RAG:
- it uses muti-query to improve correctness


# Goals
* [x] Learn more about rags, llms, llm models and creating apps with them.
* [ ] Implement a code generator that is accurate
* [ ] Implement a RAG that can answer most of the graphics queries based on its sources expecially with webgpu or vulkan 
* [ ] Make a UI to display the formatted rag outputs
* [x] Make a resume worthy project

# TODOs
* [x] Improve accuracy
    * Changed embedding model
* [x] Data from webgpu does not currently include some footnotes and warnings, include them
* [ ] Import Data On Graphics
* [x] Experiment with other models
    - Uses DeepSeekR1 1.5B distil qwen now
* [ ] Provide data source links along with the answers like in perplexity
* [ ] Experiment with indexing
* [ ] Try to implement a more accurate code generator
